Our app involves two sliding discs. The user is able to flick one of these discs from inside a box at the bottom of the 
screen in an attempt to knock the other into the goal zone at the top of the screen using collisions.

The app currently implements the above description and a main menu where the user can select a level to play. We have 
a pause button that brings up a pause menu and pauses the gameplay. A congratulations scene appears at the conclusion
of a level, when the target disc comes to rest inside the goal zone.
